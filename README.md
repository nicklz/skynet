# Skynet: ChatGPT Web Interface Automation ðŸ¤–

Skynet is a tool designed to automate interactions with the ChatGPT web interface, providing a seamless way to bypass the login system and leverage the full potential of the platform without the restrictions typically found in the official API. By using **undetected-chromedriver**, Skynet bypasses Cloudflareâ€™s protection and manually injects session headers for authenticated access through valid session tokens.

The primary goal of Skynet is to automate processes that would normally require manual interaction with ChatGPTâ€™s web interface, effectively functioning as an API replacement. This allows for advanced text generation tasks, such as **long-form text processing** that exceeds token limits, making it ideal for large-scale projects like **book authoring** or **codebase development**.

Through the web version of ChatGPT, Skynet takes advantage of **unlimited token usage** using a $20/month ChatGPT Plus subscription, significantly reducing costs compared to API-based solutions. Skynet powers advanced features like those in **Nexus Platforms**, enabling the development of complete books, large-scale coding projects, and other long-form content.

This project represents the first step in building the final version of **[Q]**, the AI powering **Nexus Platforms** and **runitbyq.com**, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven automation for long-form content creation.

Note: This is the initial commit, and while the code is functional, future updates will address potential bugs and optimizations.
